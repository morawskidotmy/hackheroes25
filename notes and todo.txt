Bike Share Research
Open Bike Share Data

Bicycle sharing system (BSS) research, beyond the analysis of individual systems, requires copious data gathering and parsing. Bike Share Research (BSR) aims to facilitate the curatation of BSS data through a collaborative and open data platform while making it API accessible.

What is a Bicycle Sharing System?

While there exists many definitions for a bicycle sharing system (BSS), we define it as being an autonomous system of accessible bikes that can be used for one way trips between stations or points within an area. While many BSS use stations with docks to lock bicycles, this is not necessary for our definition. The system must allow one way trips however, trips that end at another point than that at which it started.
API requests

Get all the data for one BSS:

bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/systems/boston

Get the list of one category for all BSS, in this example the base information:

bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/categories/base

You can specify one field of a category for all BSS, in this example the brand name:

bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/categories/base/fields/brand

Or multiple fields:

bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/categories/base/fields/launch_date,close_date

Or just for one system:

bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/categories/base/fields/brand/systems/vancouver

Get the list of BSS in one country:

bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/locations/france/
bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/locs/france/

See all the field and category names in the section Category fields below.
API submissions

If you have a large amount of data that you would like to share, rather than entering it manually you may submit using the API.

As this is potentially lethal to the entirety of the data set, it is locked. Please make contact if this is something you would like to do.

Once an apikey is provided you can submit, edit and delete data using POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP methods respectively.

This can be particularly usefull for sharing statistics:

bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/systems/boston/cats/tech/apikeys/0123456789/ (POST)

Updating a records can be done by specifying the row, category and bssid:

bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/records/75/systems/washingtondc/cats/operators/apikeys/0123456789/ (PUT)

If you wish to delete data provide the specific record endpoint:

bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/systems/boston/cats/tech/records/8/apikeys/0123456789/ (DELETE)

Data feed parsers

Parsers provide the translation of BSS data feeds, which have different structures, information and request parameters, to a standard output defined by schemas. The parsers are hosted on the github repository. There exists a variety of schemas (output formats) from which to select. To contribute new parser or schema make a pull request on github.

Our parser is still primitive, we recommend using PyBikes in the meantime. Note the PyBikes BSS id in the BSR base category.
Using BSR and parsers

The goal of the github parsers, in conjuntion with the BSR data, is to make data feed requests extremely simple. Here are a few examples:
Example: Open data feed
Chicago's Divvy

import urllib2, json
from bsrp import BSRParser

# Grab the feed we desire
chicago = urllib2.urlopen('bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/categories/data/systems/chicago')

# There may be multiple feeds in the list, let's use the first one
chicago_data_feed = json.loads(chicago.read())[0]

# create instance of parser
parser = BSRParser(chicago_data_feed)

# save Chicago's Divvy station data locally
parser.save('some/path/to/save/data/')

# done 

Example: API key requirement
Lyon's Vélo'

# We can specify a static record rather than a 'live' one as was done in the above example 
lyon = urllib2.urlopen('bikeshare-research.org/api/v1/categories/data/records/10')

# Retrieve the first item in feed list
lyon_data_feed = json.loads(lyon.read())[0]

parser = BSRParser(lyon_data_feed)

# set the api key that is required, save the raw data as well as the formatted
parser.set_apikeys('YOUR JCDECAUX API KEY').save_raw('some/path/to/save/raw_data/').save('some/path/to/save/data/') 

Why BSR?

There already exists many online resources for BSS information and data gathering, yet none provide comprehensive structured data required for the many fields of BSS research.

Here are some good existing resources:

    News about BSS (The Bike-sharing Blog)
    Wikipedia (Bicycle-sharing system)
    Map showing many existing and closed BSS (The Meddin Bike-sharing World Map)
    Live mapped data for many BSS (Bike Share Map by Oliver O'Brien)
    Live mapped data and API for many BSS (CityBik.es: Bike Sharing Networks Around the World)
    Information about Bike Sharing in Latin American
    Data feed parser used by CityBike.es (pybikes@GitHub)
    Standardized BSS data feed GBFS and the list of all systems known using it.

BSR utilizes many existing resources to provide data in a structured form to more easily be compared, extracted and analyzed.

Nextbike (Worldwide)
API

URL: api.nextbike.net/maps/nextbike-live.json as JSON or api.nextbike.net/maps/nextbike-live.xml as XML.
Filtering

You also can filter by city, with the GET-Parameter city. Eg. api.nextbike.net/maps/nextbike-live.json?city=362 for Berlin. In some cities there’s an artificial split into separate systems (while the bikes are interchangeable) - you can provide multiple city ids separated by commas - e.g. nextbike.net/maps/nextbike-official.xml?city=372,210,475 lists all Warsaw bikes.
Flexzones

For some cities nextbike has flexzones (free floating in these zones). At the moment these are:

    Berlin api.nextbike.net/reservation/geojson/flexzone_bn.json
    Dresden api.nextbike.net/reservation/geojson/flexzone_sz.json
    Karlsruhe api.nextbike.net/reservation/geojson/flexzone_fg.json
    Köln api.nextbike.net/reservation/geojson/flexzone_kg.json
    Leipzig api.nextbike.net/reservation/geojson/flexzone_le.json
    Nürnberg api.nextbike.net/reservation/geojson/flexzone_nb.json
    For all zones: api.nextbike.net/reservation/geojson/flexzone_all.json

GBFS

Nextbike provides different GBFS endpoints for their different networks/brands/countries: api.nextbike.net/maps/gbfs/v1/nextbike_<NETWORK-ID>/gbfs.json. You can find the Network-ID in the api.nextbike.net/maps/nextbike-live.json, just search for the "domain" JSON Key in country root object. So GBFS endpoint for Germany would be api.nextbike.net/maps/gbfs/v1/nextbike_de/gbfs.json. Warning: Not all german citys are in the de endpoint, e.g. in Berlin nextbike partnered with Deezer and uses Network-ID/country code bn.

sharedmobility.github.io
Introduction:

VOI is a Swedish ride sharing company focused on electric scooters. They have scooters placed in several cities and countries around the world, including Sweden, Spain, Italy, France and more.

Base url of the API is api.voiapp.io/v1
Authentication:

The API requires an Access Token. This token is valid for only a short time (10 minutes I think, I haven’t tried to measure). You get the Access Token by opening a session. You need an Authentication Token to open a session. When opening a session, you get:

    an Access Token that you can use in the next 10 minutes or so to query data
    a new Authentication Token to open the next session

To get the first Authentication Token, see steps 1,2,3 below.

See here example of python implementation of the session authentication (once the step 1-2-3 are done): github.com/hawisizu/scooter_scrapper/blob/master/providers/voi.py
1 - Get OTP

POST request to api.voiapp.io/v1/auth/verify/phone

Body: raw/JSON

{
    "country_code": "DE",
    "phone_number": "176xxxxxxxx"
}

Note: phone number is without any 0.

In the body of the answer, you get a UUID in a param token, and of course an SMS message to the provided phone number.

{
"token": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

2 - Verify OTP

This request gets nothing in the answer, but is necessary so that the token works. The code should be the value received by SMS.

POST request to api.voiapp.io/v1/auth/verify/code

Body: raw/JSON

{
    "code": "123456",
    "token": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

Answer is 204 with no content.
3 - Get first authToken

POST request to api.voiapp.io/v1/auth/verify/presence

Body: raw/JSON:

{
    "email": "xxx@xxx.com",
    "token": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

(the email should apparently be valid) Answer will be:

{
    "authenticationToken": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

(the token is really super long)
4 - Open Session

POST request to api.voiapp.io/v1/auth/session

Body: raw/JSON

{
    "authenticationToken": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

Answer will be:

{
    "accessToken": "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy",
    "authenticationToken": "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
}

You will then use the accessToken to query the data, and the authenticationToken to open the next session, so that you don’t have to re-do step 1-2-3
Access scooter data

Once you have an Access Token, you can query the zones info, or if you already know which zone you want to query, get the scooters of the zone.
Get zones info

GET request to api.voiapp.io/v1/zones In the headers you need the access token you got when opening a session: x-access-token: yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Answer: a long json with all the zones where VOI is currently operating, with details on the prices and forbidden zones, the max speed, etc. See here an example of the full zones json retrieved on Dec 20th, 2019: gist.github.com/hawisizu/4d54000dc4d5d6d2e39f6994006b74d2

Notes:

    you can also filter the results by passing lng and lat as params of the GET request.
    in the json there are some test cities

Get Scooter info

GET request to api.voiapp.io/v2/rides/vehicles?zone_id=<ZONE_ID>

<ZONE_ID> has to be the ID of one of the zones.

In the headers you need the access token you got when opening a session: x-access-token: yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Answer:

{
  "data": {
    "vehicle_groups": [
      {
        "price_token": "...",
        "group_type": "scooter",
        "vehicles": [
          {
            "id": "274db72d-f108-417a-93e3-46acb61cfd26",
            "short": "kpne",
            "battery": 55,
            "location": {
              "lng": 18.11346435546875,
              "lat": 59.34138107299805
            },
            "zone_id": "1"
          },
          {
            "id": "3bd0b7bf-15c0-46f8-9d3b-ecb962f1f5d5",
            "short": "bnjs",
            "battery": 78,
            "location": {
              "lng": 18.088924407958984,
              "lat": 59.354530334472656
            },
            "zone_id": "1"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

The response is a nested object with information about each scooter, in a JSON format. Here is a list of the parameters in each scooter object and information about what they (most likely) do:

id: A scooter ID that most likely is used internally.

short: A four-character shortcode of the VOI scooter, which is used to unlock it in the app if you don´t scan the QR code on the scooter.

battery: An integer representing the battery percentage of the scooter.

location: An object of the scooter location.

zone_id: This is most likely an indication of what zone the scooter is located in. Each VOI zone is represented by an integer.

What is GBFS?

The General Bikeshare Feed Specification, known as GBFS, is the open data standard for shared mobility. GBFS makes real-time data feeds in a uniform format publicly available online, with an emphasis on findability. GBFS is intended to make information publicly available online; therefore information that is personally identifiable is not currently and will not become part of the core specification.

GBFS was created in 2014 by Mitch Vars with collaboration from public, private sector and non-profit shared mobility system owners and operators, application developers, and technology vendors. Michael Frumin, Jesse Chan-Norris and others made significant contributions of time and expertise toward the development of v1.0 on behalf of Motivate International LLC (now Lyft). The North American Bikeshare Association’s endorsement, support, and hosting was key to its success starting in 2015. In 2019, NABSA chose MobilityData to govern and facilitate the improvement of GBFS. MobilityData hosts a GBFS Resource Center and a public GBFS Slack channel - you are welcome to contact us there or at sharedmobility@mobilitydata.org with questions.

GBFS is intended as a specification for real-time, read-only data - any data being written back into individual shared mobility systems are excluded from this spec.

The specification has been designed with the following concepts in mind:

    Provide the status of the system at this moment
    Do not provide information whose primary purpose is historical

The data in the specification contained in this document is intended for consumption by clients intending to provide real-time (or semi-real-time) transit advice and is designed as such.
How to Participate

GBFS is an open source project developed under a consensus-based governance model. Contributors come from across the shared mobility industry, public sector, civic technology and elsewhere. GBFS is not owned by any one person or organization. The specification is not fixed or unchangeable. As the shared mobility industry evolves, it is expected that the specification will be extended by the GBFS community to include new features and capabilities over time.

Comments or questions can be addressed to the community by opening an issue. Proposals for changes or additions to the specification can be made through pull requests. Questions can also be addressed to the community via the public GBFS Slack channel or to the shared mobility staff at MobilityData: sharedmobility@mobilitydata.org. If you are new to engaging with the community on this repository, firstly welcome! Here is a brief overview of how to contribute to the specification:

    Anyone can raise an issue.
    Anyone can open a pull request - make sure PRs in line with our Guiding Principles.
    If you are wanting to open a pull request but don't know how, MobiilityData is happy to help. Get in touch at sharedmobility@mobilitydata.org.
    Discussions on pull requests must be a minimum of 7 calendar days.
    Votes are open for a total of 10 calendar days, anyone can vote.
    A successful vote must have at least 3 votes, not including the pull request author.
    A successful vote must include a vote from a GBFS producer and a GBFS consumer.

Full Version History

The complete GBFS version history is available in the Release Notes.
Specification Versioning

To enable the evolution of GBFS, including changes that would otherwise break backwards-compatibility with consuming applications, GBFS uses semantic versioning. Semantic versions are established by a git tag in the form of vX.Y where X.Y is the version name. A whole integer increase is used for breaking changes (MAJOR changes). A decimal increase is used for non-breaking changes (MINOR changes or patches). MINOR versions may introduce new features as long as those changes are OPTIONAL and do not break backwards compatibility.

Examples of breaking changes include:

    Changes to requirements, like adding or removing a REQUIRED endpoint or field, or changing an OPTIONAL endpoint or field to REQUIRED.
    Changing the data type or semantics of an existing field.

Examples of non-breaking changes include:

    Adding an OPTIONAL endpoint or field
    Adding new enum values
    Modifying documentation or specification language in a way that clarifies semantics or recommended practices

Release Deprecation

    GBFS documentation will include a list of current and supported MAJOR and MINOR versions. Supported versions SHALL NOT span more than two MAJOR versions. Past versions that are beyond the two most recent MAJOR versions will be deprecated 180 days after the latest MAJOR version becomes official.

Version Release Cycles

    See the Governance for Version Release Cycles.

Guiding Principles

To preserve the original vision of GBFS, the following guiding principles should be taken into consideration when proposing extensions to the spec:

    GBFS is a specification for real-time or semi-real-time, read-only data. The spec is not intended for historical or archival data such as trip records. The spec is about public information intended for shared mobility users.

    GBFS is targeted at providing transit information to the shared mobility end user. Its primary purpose is to power tools for riders that will make shared mobility more accessible to users. GBFS is about public information. Producers and owners of GBFS data should take licensing and discoverability into account when publishing GBFS feeds.

    Changes to the spec should be backwards-compatible, when possible. Caution should be taken to avoid making changes to the spec that would render existing feeds invalid.

    Speculative features are discouraged. Each new addition to the spec adds complexity. We want to avoid additions to the spec that do not provide additional value to the shared mobility end user.

Systems Catalog - Systems Implementing GBFS

There are hundreds of shared mobility systems publishing GBFS worldwide. This list contains all known systems publishing GBFS feeds and is maintained by the GBFS community. This is an incomplete list. If you have or are aware of a system that doesn’t appear on the list please add it.

If you would like to add a system, please fork this repository and submit a Pull Request. To open a Pull Request, please do the following:

    Create an account on GitHub if you do not already have one
    Fork this repository
    Create a new branch, and
    Propose your changes by opening a new pull request

Please keep this list alphabetized by country and system name. Alternatively, fill out this contribution form for a Github-less contribution.

    systems.csv

Authentication Type 	Conditionally REQUIRED 	If authentication is required, the type MUST be included. The Authentication Type field defines the type of authentication required to access the feed. Valid values for this field are:

    0 or (empty) - No authentication required.
    1 - The authentication requires an API key, which should be passed as value of the parameter Authentication Parameter Name in the URL. Please visit the URL in Authentication Info URL for more information.
    2 - The authentication requires an HTTP header, which should be passed as the value of the header Authentication Parameter Name in the HTTP request. 

When not provided, the authentication type is assumed to be 0.
Authentication Parameter Name 	Conditionally REQUIRED 	If authentication is required, the parameter name MUST be included. The Authentication Parameter Name field defines the name of the parameter to pass in the URL or header to provide the authentication credentials. This field is required for Authentication Type=1 and Authentication Type=2. In case of multiple parameters, use the pipe character to separate them (|).
GBFS JSON Schemas

Complete JSON schemas for each version of GBFS can be found here.
GBFS and Other Shared Mobility Resources

Including APIs, datasets, validators, research, and software can be found here.
Relationship Between GBFS and MDS

There are many similarities between GBFS and MDS (Mobility Data Specification), however, their intended use cases are different. GBFS is a real-time or near real-time specification for public data primarily intended to provide transit advice through consumer-facing applications. MDS is not public data and is intended for use only by mobility regulators. Publishing a public GBFS feed is a requirement of all MDS compatible Provider APIs.

i want to create an api that will work in poland and it will get you the closest bike and calculate how much less co2 you made by renting a bike/scooter instead of driving a car, it should have one endpoint which would require 2 variables, lattitude and logtitude of where you are and where you want to go 
.
GPT-4o mini
API Design for Carbon Footprint Calculation by Bike/Scooter

Here's a proposed structure for your API that calculates the closest bike or scooter and estimates the CO2 savings from choosing a bike/scooter over driving a car in Poland.
API Overview

    Base URL: https://api.yourservice.com/v1
    Endpoint: /calculate-co2-savings

Request Parameters
Parameter	Type	Required	Description
latitude	Float	Yes	Latitude of the user's current location.
longitude	Float	Yes	Longitude of the user's current location.
destination_latitude	Float	Yes	Latitude of the destination.
destination_longitude	Float	Yes	Longitude of the destination.
Request Example

http

POST /v1/calculate-co2-savings
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "latitude": 52.2297,
  "longitude": 21.0122,
  "destination_latitude": 52.4064,
  "destination_longitude": 16.9252
}

Response Structure
Field	Type	Description
closest_vehicle	Object	Details about the closest bike or scooter available.
co2_savings	Float	Estimated CO2 savings in kilograms.
distance	Float	Distance to the destination in kilometers.
travel_time	String	Estimated time to reach the destination by bike/scooter.
Response Example

json

{
  "closest_vehicle": {
    "id": "S36SM4A4WIDBP",
    "type": "bike",
    "location": {
      "latitude": 52.2345,
      "longitude": 21.0145
    },
    "battery_level": "High"
  },
  "co2_savings": 0.56,
  "distance": 3.5,
  "travel_time": "15 minutes"
}

Workflow

    Get User Location: The user provides their current latitude and longitude, along with their desired destination's latitude and longitude.
    Find Closest Vehicle: The API queries the available bikes/scooters in the area to find the closest one.
    Calculate Distance: Calculate the distance between the user’s current location and the destination using the Haversine formula.
    Estimate CO2 Savings:
        Average CO2 emissions for a car is approximately 120 grams/km.
        Calculate savings using the formula: CO2 Savings=Distance×120 grams/km

Technologies and Considerations

    Data Source: Integrate with available bike/scooter APIs (like GBFS) to get real-time availability.
    Geolocation Service: Use APIs like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to calculate distances.
    Unit Testing: Ensure robust error handling, especially with invalid inputs or unavailable vehicles.
    Documentation: Provide thorough API documentation for developers using tools like Swagger or Postman.

Next Steps

    Prototype the API: Build a basic version using a web framework (e.g., Flask, Express).
    Integrate Data Sources: Connect to bike/scooter APIs and geolocation services.
    Test and Deploy: Perform rigorous testing before deployment.

Feel free to adjust any part of this design or ask for further details!
